Someone clicks a number, it needs to know whether to add that to the first or second number.
The way to know that if by whether there's an operator.

if there's no operator
firstNum += firstNum

if there's an operator
secondNum += secondNum

But it's not that simple, because it also needs to make sure they're not putting in something else.

Categories of inputs...
1. Number
2. Operator
3. Equals
4. Clear


# Rewrite my program

Try to separate out functions and variables. e.g. functions to check if it's a number, operator, equals, or clear.
I'm tempted to skip ahead. But I'll just take the evening off and 
Try to figure out the other reuirements tomorrow with a fresh mind.

Maybe even write some pseudocode to think through the other requirements.
